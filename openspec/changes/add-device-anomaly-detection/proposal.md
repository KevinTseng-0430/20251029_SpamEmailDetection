## Why
IoT devices can experience anomalies that indicate potential failures or security issues. Automated detection of these anomalies is crucial for maintaining system reliability and preventing downtime.

## What Changes
- Add real-time anomaly detection system for device telemetry
- Implement ML-based anomaly detection model
- Create anomaly notification system
- Add historical anomaly tracking and analysis

## Impact
- Affected specs: monitoring capability
- Affected code: ML pipeline, notification system, telemetry processor
 - New dependencies: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy for anomaly detection and preprocessing
