## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Automated Anomaly Detection
The system SHALL automatically detect anomalies in device telemetry data using machine learning algorithms.

#### Scenario: Normal Device Operation
- **WHEN** device telemetry is within normal operating parameters
- **THEN** no anomaly alerts are generated

#### Scenario: Anomaly Detection
- **WHEN** device telemetry deviates significantly from normal patterns
- **THEN** an anomaly is detected and logged
- **AND** relevant stakeholders are notified

### Requirement: Anomaly Analysis Dashboard
The system SHALL provide a dashboard for analyzing detected anomalies.

#### Scenario: View Anomaly History
- **WHEN** a user accesses the anomaly dashboard
- **THEN** they can view historical anomaly data
- **AND** filter anomalies by device, type, and time period

#### Scenario: Anomaly Investigation
- **WHEN** a user selects a specific anomaly
- **THEN** they can view detailed telemetry data
- **AND** access related device context
